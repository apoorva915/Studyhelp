## Project Description

The project is a Next.js Full Stack AI-Powered LMS SaaS Platform designed to deliver on-demand, personalized learning content using advanced AI and modern web technologies. It bridges the gap between structured learning and accessibility by allowing users to input a topic, select a material type (exam prep, interview, learning, coding, etc.), and choose a difficulty level, after which the platform generates tailored course materials like outlines, notes, flashcards, and quizzes using Gemini AI.
The system is optimized for scalability, real-time generation, and engagement, making it perfect for learners at all stagesâ€”from school students to competitive exam aspirants, job seekers, and lifelong learners. It also supports subscription-based access, interactive content, and real-time progress tracking.
